This file tries to describe the current CERTI release process.
Current version is written for a CERTI administrator
and may certainly be only readable for them.
Note:
  We were using CVS until CERTI 3.4.2 (included)
  we now use GIT. CERTI 3.4.3 being the first release
  using GIT.

CERTI releases should be done with the following steps:

1) Announce release freeze on certi-devel
   and check for no-go message

2) Review currently opened and fixed bug/task in the tracker

    Bugs:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=certi
    - check if fixed bugs are really in GIT and
      switch status
            from ReadyToTest to Done
            from Open to Closed
      check the Release version.

    Patches:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=certi
    - check those which are "Ready For Test"
      switch status
             from ReadyForTest to Done
             from Open to Closed

    Tasks:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?group=certi
    - checked Done or ReadyToTest tasks
      close them and fix the Release.

3) Edit certi/CMakeLists.txt
   and bump the version to the right number with
   [example for certi-3.4.3]

   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "3")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "4")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "3")

4) commit the modified files
   certi/CMakeLists.txt
   with a meaningful comment saying you are preparing a CERTI version

5) Do a fresh checkout somewhere
   Build certi from your pristine source tree

     Better is at least 2 built:
         Linux ix86 wth gcc  (32bits)
         Windows win32 with Visual Studio
                and/or Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/)
                and/or MinGW (http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net)+Eclipse CDT

6) Run autotests :))
   Which means for today run as many tests as you can do
      - billard
      - HLA Tutorial
      - HLA TestsSuite
   All those tests do have an associated dtest scripts.
   see for example certi/tests/Billard/dtest_billard.py
   or HLA_TestsSuite/dtest_*.py

7) Tag certi tree with appropriate version

     git tag -a CERTI-3_4_3 -m "CERTI Release 3.4.3"

   Generate the Changelog file using  git log command like:
     git log --format="%ai %an%n%n%x09*%w(79,1,10)%s%d%n"
   You may even store this git log format using:
     git config --global pretty.gnucl "%ai %an%n%n%x09*%w(79,1,10)%s%d%n"
   then use:
     git log --format=gnucl

   For example updating Changelog for CERTI 3.4.2 to 3.4.3 will be done
   using the following command:

   cd /path/to/certi
   git --no-pager log CERTI-3_4_2..CERTI-3_4_3 --format="%ai %an%n%n%x09*%w(79,1,10)%s %d%n" >> ChangeLog

   commit the ChangeLog file
   git add ChangeLog
   git commit -m "Update ChangeLog for CERTI Release 3.4.3"
   force the tag on it:
   git tag -a -f CERTI-3_4_3 -m "CERTI Release 3.4.3"

   forward the change to Savannah
   git push
   git push --tags

8) Make certi packages using cpack
     - tar.gz (sources)              [mandatory]
         make package_source
     - RPM (sources and binaries)    [optional]
         cpack -G RPM
     - Win32 NSIS binary installer   [recommended]
     	 cpack -G NSIS

9) Tests your packages or ask for help to test them
   on certi-devel
   Fix packaging trouble if any and move the previous tag
   if any commit occurred.

10) Digitally sign the packages you made and put them
    in the download area:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/DownloadArea

    gpg -b certi-3.4.3.tar.gz

    scp certi-3.4.3.tar.gz* <user>@dl.sv.nongnu.org:/releases/certi/

11) Check if the download area has been properly updated
    http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/

    Beware the automatic mirror selection, go to
    the "noredirect" link:
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/certi/

    Or look at the mirror monitoring:
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/mirmon/

12) Post the appropriate news on Savannah CERTI pages
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/news/submit.php?group=certi

    DON'T MAIL to certi-devel since news are
    automagically forwarded to appropriate ML

    Remember that once you have posted the news you should
    approve it before it appears on first page.

13) OPTIONALLY update online CERTI documentation at
        http://www.nongnu.org/certi

You are right this process IS painful and should be automated (a lot...)
be sure we are working on it :))
